## 3. Learnings from the Git Crash Program

**ðŸ§  What I Thought I'd Learn vs What I Actually Learned**
**1. Concept: Branching**

Expectation ðŸ™ƒ : I thought branching was only for teams working on big projects and wouldnâ€™t be useful in solo work.

Reality ðŸ˜…: Turns out branches are super handy for testing different ideas without messing up my main progress.

Impact ðŸ’¡: I used branches to work on my "About Me" and "Projects" sections separately and merged them after testing.

**2. Concept: Issues and Milestones**

Expectation ðŸ™ƒ : I expected issues and milestones to be overkill for small projects.

Reality ðŸ˜…: They actually helped me plan and track progress in my portfolio project.

Impact ðŸ’¡: I created an "Add Skills Section" milestone with linked issues, which helped keep things organized.

**3. Concept: Pull Requests**

Expectation ðŸ™ƒ : I thought pull requests were only for team code reviews.

Reality ðŸ˜…: Even solo devs can use PRs to track changes and experiment safely.

Impact ðŸ’¡: I created a PR for my updated contact section and reviewed it before merging to avoid mistakes.

**4. Concept: Merge Conflicts**

Expectation ðŸ™ƒ : I thought I wouldnâ€™t experience any conflicts working alone.

Reality ðŸ˜…: I created two branches and edited the same line to test how merge conflicts work.

Impact ðŸ’¡: I learned how to resolve conflicts manually and commit the resolved version.

## 4. Screenshots of Key GitHub Features


### A. Milestones and Issues

I used milestones to group related issues for each major section of my portfolio. This helped me break down the work and stay on track.Below is an example of of the issues under the milestone for Developing the about page for Kelly's personal portfolio

### B. Project Board

I created a GitHub Project Board to visually track progress during development. Tasks were moved across columns â€” "To Do", "In Progress", and "Done" â€” to help me prioritize and stay focused.

### C. Branching

To work on different parts of my portfolio independently, I created multiple branches. This ensured I could test features without affecting the main user experience.

### D. Pull Requests

Here's a screenshot of a pull request I made to merge my past projects branch to the services section of my portfolio.

### E. Merge Conflict Resolution

While merging two branches, I intentionally created a merge conflict in the assignment.md file. I resolved the conflict manually in VS Code and committed the changes.
